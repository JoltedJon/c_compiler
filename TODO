Semantic Analysis:

- Checks to see if types are compatible is not implemented
- Finish checking for returns in non-void function

Syntax Analysis:

- Need to parse function pointer declarations
- Struct and union parsing needs to be implemented
- Declarator lists needs to be implemented
- Initalizer lists
- Many TODOs that are not currently finished need to be implemented

Lexing:

- String concatenation is not implemented and this will cause errors if anyone uses that feature.
- Any TODO that hasn't been implemented yet
