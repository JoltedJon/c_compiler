Currently working on Semantic Analysis:
  - Implemented finding labels for goto statements
  - Implemented resolving identifiers to ensure no use of unused identifiers

  - Implement struct/union field checking before type resolution
  - Need to Finish type resolving by giving each expression the correct data type.
    - Currently plan on adding an implicit cast node on expressions that need to change their types for a higher expression
    - Need to store return type of Function in context to ensure that functions are returning correct type
  - Basic control flow, need to ensure continue and break aren't used outside of loops or switch statements for break, default and case can on

Syntax Analysis:
  - Cast Expression parsing needs to be implemented
  - Need to parse function pointer declarations
  - Struct and union parsing needs to be implemented
  - Declarator lists needs to be implemented
  - Initalizer lists
  - Many TODOs that are not currently finished need to be implemented

Lexing:
  - String concatenation is not implemented and this will cause errors if anyone uses that feature.
  - Any TODO that hasn't been implemented yet
